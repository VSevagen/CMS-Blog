                            It all started with a simple message which was completely unexpected.<br></br>

                            I was like, why ??‚Ä¶why me?? . I knew it was going to be my turn one day but not as soon as this. Anyway I did not have a choice so I had to prepare something and quick as it was gonna happen in 1 day.<br></br><br></br>

So I started searching for a topic that would keeps the guys awake and captivated. I spent my whole morning from 9.00 am to 1.00 pm doing just that. By that time. I had already covered 5 topics, Attitude and its benefit, Python and the future and 3 more which I do not even remember. üôÇ<br></br><br></br>

At 7.00 pm, I had to no choice but to choose one and that is when I got the bling. Why not introduce them to scuba diving !! There are several reasons why I think that topic would be best one for me.<br></br><br></br>

<strong>Reason 1</strong>: I‚Äôm no slouch in scuba diving. I‚Äôm a certified PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) Rescue diver with more than 100+ dives on my record. I‚Äôve also completed my EFR (Emergency First Response ) certification along with it.<br></br><br></br>

<strong>Reason 2</strong>: Scuba diving is like second nature to me. Even if I do not dive for 1 or 2 years, it is a skill which is unforgettable. All the safety procedures, the water entry techniques, the scuba diving signs etc‚Ä¶ I know those like the back of my hand.<br></br><br></br>

<strong>Reason 3</strong>: I‚Äôll be ready for questions. Whatever questions I might be asked at the end of the session, I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôll be able to answer every single one of them.<br></br><br></br>

Once I got my topic, I started with the slides. Took me one hour and started a small refresher session with myself(Diving is not something you forget but the technical terms ,yes).<br></br><br></br>

The next day was the big day. I went through the slides in the morning, tried reviewing the technical terms, did some self-explanation as if I was talking to an audience and that was it. ‚ÄúBig round of applause for Sevagen‚Äù, I was asked to come forward and start. My heart got panicky and beat its drum loudly in order to appeal to the other senses for help. It beat faster and faster until its palpitation gathered the speed of a race-horse. Finally I opened my mouth and started uttering a few words. The last thing I knew is that I spoke for a non-stop 30 minutes. I was surprised myself that I spoke that much.<br></br><br></br>

Anyway the lesson I got from this experience is to face your fears, whatever they might be. They will do nothing but prevent you from improving in life. They will hold you back from opportunities which you could easily obtain.

So do not hold back, do whatever you think might be beneficial for you before it is too late.
